/* 
  Scope is a function based thing.
  Scope means what is the variable access
  of a function when it is invoked. And
  what is in the variable environment.

  作用域与函数相关。

  Context is more about object based.
  Context says what's the value of `this`,
  which is a reference to the object that
  owns that current executing code.

  上下文与对象相关。
  Context is most often determined by how
  a function is invoked with `this`, while
  Scope refers to the visibility of variables.
